Web tech Project SEM3 project name-SKRIBLY  
### IDEA:  
This is a fun, simple and interactive website designed to help users create their own comic strip and share them.  
 
### DETAILS:  
 A user must create a free account and register themselves in order to start creating projects. The home page will consist of a slideshow of select works made by users in the background.  
If a user is finding it difficult to navigate the website, a tutorial demonstrating all the features is available to aid them. This will open in a pop-up window.  
They can create comic strips based on a few “templates” that the website would provide. These would include a set of characters (boy, girl, man, woman, animals, book characters, etc.), comic strip layout (grid of 4 boxes, row of 3 boxes, row of 4 boxes, etc.), things/objects, dialogue bubbles, background/scene, etc.  
While creating, the user can select which layout they want for the comic. They can then select which characters and objects they wish to include in the comic from the buttons. These options can be dragged onto the canvas.  
Each user will have their own “workspace canvas”, which can be customised to their desire. This workspace will be loaded every time they log in. They can choose to either display their works publicly on the homepage or display them privately only to other registered.  
A user will also have the option to view other artists’ gallery page that will display their projects, and they can leave reactions and comments.  
All the works and workspace preferences will be stored in a database.  
Each work will be given a watermark which is unique to every user so as to prevent plagiarism of projects.  
 
 
This project stands out as most of the current websites do not offer the feature of displaying your work; rather they are tools using which you create a comic and then download it. There isn’t any option to view other artist’s work.  
 
### FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:  
A feature where the user may upload their own picture files to the comic.  
A feature where the user can draw using mouse input.
